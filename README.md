# EvolveU / InceptionU Curriculum

<h3 align="center"><b>⭒❃.✮:▹:wave: Hi! I'm <a href="https://github.com/brennanbrown">Brennan</a>, an EvolveU alumni. Wanna hire me? <a href="https://brennnanbrown.ca">Click here!</a>◃:✮.❃⭒</b></h3>

EvolveU / InceptionU is a full-time program in Calgary, Alberta. The material blends technology, people, and process skills into one fully integrated experience. During my time with the program, I learned coding languages and frameworks such as; Python, JavaScript, Flask, Bootstrap, OpenPyXL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQLAlchemy, and REACT.js  and non-technical skills such as; critical thinking, working in teams, design thinking, and workplace readiness. The classroom is designed to simulate a agile working environment, and includes daily stand-ups, weekly sprints, and weekly retrospectives.

The Full Stack Developer program is designed to develop the technical skills needed to become a Full Stack Developer, and to help learners adopt a growth mindset to future-proof themselves in an ever-changing digital economy. A Full Stack Developer is a person who has the skills to do back-end development work (coding, databases design, and programming) and front-end development work (design and UX/UI). 

Led by an on-site team lead, learners engage in project-based experiences delivered both online and in the classroom. Participants learn to state and analyze complex problems, uncover assumptions, collaborate with peers and distinguish between what is known and unknown to drive effective systems development.
